## Project Description
Detecting and preventing fake job postings carries significant social and business implications. On the social front, firstly, it protects job seekers from falling victim to fraudulent activities, as fake job postings can lead to financial scams and identity theft. Secondly, it helps job platforms to maintain user trust. If the platform is plagued by fake job postings, users may lose confidence in the platform's reliability, affecting its reputation. On the other hand, in the business realm, identifying fake job postings early on helps optimize resources for both job seekers and recruiters. It ensures that real opportunities receive the attention they deserve and that job seekers are not wasting time on deceptive postings.

However, this endeavor is challenged by fraudsters who employ sophisticated techniques, leading to diverse patterns of fraudulent activity. The diverse nature of fraud patterns make it difficult for the system to detect fake job postings. Also, the number of fake job postings is often significantly lower than legitimate ones. Such imbalance poses challenges in training models effectively, as the model may become biased towards the majority class. Moreover, fraudsters adapt their strategies over time. As machine learning models are deployed, fraudsters may change their tactics, making it a continuous challenge to stay ahead in the detection game. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of advanced machine learning techniques, continuous monitoring, collaboration with cybersecurity experts, and a commitment to staying updated on emerging fraud patterns.
